Testing the Getting Started Guide
===============================================

This test checks that the getting started guide is accurate and works
in it's entirety. In addition to checking all of the functionality in
the getting started guide, it verifies that the guide is up to date
and accurate.

*To run this test:*

1. Click *New* so that you are starting fresh.

2. Click *Getting Started*.

   - The getting started guide should pop up in it's own window,
     arrange these side by side for ease of use.
     
   - If the getting started guide fails to appear, this test fails.

   
3. Follow the instructions of the guide exactly.

   - Exactly means if it says drag, drag don't use the context
     menu. This goes for any explicitly stated action.
     
   - If anything doesn't do exactly what it says, report the issue.
   
   - If the issue is minor like it says *Subsystem 1* should appear,
     and in reality *Subsystem* appears, it is acceptable to release
     to beta. Otherwise, this test has failed.
