  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>An ultrasonic rangefinder using high frequency sound to
  determine distance to an object. The rangefinders generally
  operate at distances up to 7-9 feet. There are two styles of
  sensors in common use, some that use two transducers (a
  microphone and a speaker) and those that use a single transducer.
  The commonly used single transducer sensor is supplied by
  Maxbotics and uses an analog connection to the robot.</p>

  <p>The sensor implemented by this class is the double transducer
  style with two digital I/O connections to the robot, one (output)
  to cause the sensor to send a ping and the other (input) to
  determine the distance to the target.</p>

  <p><b>If your application uses the analog sensor, then don't use
  this class</b>. Instead just use an analog input and refer to the
  sensor documentation for the mapping between voltage and
  distance.</p>
