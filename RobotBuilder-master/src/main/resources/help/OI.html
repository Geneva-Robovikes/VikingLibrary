  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>The OI is the operator interface. It connects the buttons and
  joysticks that the operator uses to the commands which they
  should trigger. The buttons in the OI make it really easy to
  change the functions that each button performs as you test the
  code and add new commands to make the operators job easier.</p>

  <h2>What types of buttons are there?</h2>

  <p>There are a number of buttons that can be used to trigger
  commands.</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Button</th>

      <th>Class</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>JoystickButton</td>

      <td>A button on a joystick. This is probably the most useful
      type of button.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>InternalButton</td>

      <td>A virtual button that can be triggered in code or put on
      the SmartDashboard.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>NetworkButton</td>

      <td>A button that is triggered by a value on a network table.
      This is useful for allowing code not on the roboRIO to
      trigger commands.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Custom</td>

      <td>Custom buttons can be created by subclassing Button and
      overriding the isPressed method.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
