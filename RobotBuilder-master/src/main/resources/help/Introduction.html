  <h1>Welcome to RobotBuilder</h1>

  <p>Currently, there is alot of development going on. For the
  latest most accurate information, please go to <a href=
  "https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robotbuilder/index.html">frc-docs</a>.
  Once that documentation settles down, we hope to include it
  here.</p>

  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>RobotBuilder is an application designed to aid the robot
  development process. Robot builder can help you:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Generating boilerplate code.</li>

    <li>Organize your robot and figure out what its key subsystems
    are.</li>

    <li>Check that you have enough channels for all of your sensors
    and actuators.</li>

    <li>Generate wiring diagrams.</li>

    <li>Easily modify your operator interface.</li>

    <li>More...</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>This section will take you through the basics of using
  RobotBuilder to develop a simple robot with tank drive. We will
  cover:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Subsystems: The physical parts of your robot.</li>

    <li>Commands: The actions your robot can perform.</li>

    <li>Operator Interface: How your drivers interact with the
    robot.</li>

    <li>Generating boilerplate code.</li>

    <li>Generating wiring diagrams.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Subsystems</h3>

  <p>Subsystems are RobotBuilders way of organizing your robot. A
  subsystem should represent a distinct part of the robot that
  performs a particular subset of tasks. For example, a Drive Train
  consists of a series of motors that drive it and maybe some
  encoders to measure it's speed and distance. For more, see:
  <a href="Subsystem.html">Subsystems</a> and <a href=
  "Subsystem.html">Subsystem</a></p>

  <h4>Creating the Drive Train</h4>

  <p>The first step on the way to a fully functional subsystem is
  to create the subsystem, so that it exists in your robot
  tree.</p>

  <p class="lead">To create the Drive Train subsystem:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Subsystem" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over Subsystems in the robot tree and release.

      <p>A new subystem has been created.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Naming the Drive Train</h4>

  <p>After you have a subsytem created, it is very helpful to give
  it a name.</p>

  <p class="lead">To name the subsystem:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on the newly created "Subsystem".

      <p>It's properties will appear on the right.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Double click the cell to the right of name, that contains
    "Subsystem".</li>

    <li>Edit it to read "Drive Train".

      <p>It's new name appears in the tree.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Adding a Robot Drive to the Drive Train</h4>

  <p>The easiest way to make your robot drive is to us the
  RobotDrive object in WPILib. It provides methods for tank drive,
  arcade drive and mecanum drive.</p>

  <p class="lead">To add a robot drive to your Drive Train:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Robot Drive 2" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over "Drive Train" in the robot tree and release.

      <p>Your Drive Train now has a robot drive object.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Rename it to "Robot Drive", the same way you renamed the
    "Drive Train".</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Adding Motors to the Robot Drive</h4>

  <p>The RobotDrive object needs motors for both it's left and and
  it's right side.</p>

  <p class="lead">To add motors to your robot drive:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Jaguar" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over "Robot Drive" in the robot tree and
    release.</li>

    <li>Rename it to "Left Jaguar", the same way you renamed the
    "Drive Train".</li>

    <li>Click on "Jaguar" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over "Robot Drive" in the robot tree and
    release.</li>

    <li>Rename it to "Right Jaguar", the same way you renamed the
    "Drive Train".</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Checking That the Motors are Correctly Assigned</h4>

  <p>The RobotDrive object tries to guess which motors are which,
  but it's helpful to check that they are correctly assigned to the
  proper side.</p>

  <p class="lead">To add motors to your robot drive:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Robot Drive".</li>

    <li>Make sure that the "Left Motor" property is set to "Left
    Jaguar", if not click on it and select "Left Jaguar".</li>

    <li>Make sure that the "Right Motor" property is set to "Right
    Jaguar", if not click on it and select "Right Jaguar".</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You now have a subsystem representing your robots Drive
  Train!</p>

  <h3>Commands</h3>

  <p>Commands are a way of representing actions that your robot can
  take. Commands can be bound to buttons and other triggers to run
  under certain conditions. They can also be chained in <a href=
  "Command%20Group.html">command groups</a> to perform a more
  complex series of actions built from existing commands. For more,
  see: <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> and <a href=
  "Command.html">Command</a></p>

  <h4>Creating the Tank Drive Command</h4>

  <p>The first step to create a command is to add it to the robot
  tree under commands.</p>

  <p class="lead">To create the command:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Command" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over Commands in the robot tree and release.

      <p>A new command has been created.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Naming the Tank Drive Command</h4>

  <p>After you have a command created, it is very helpful to give
  it a meaningful name.</p>

  <p class="lead">To name the command:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on the newly created "Command".

      <p>It's properties will appear on the right.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Double click the cell to the right of name, that contains
    "Command".</li>

    <li>Edit it to read "Tank Drive".

      <p>It's new name appears in the tree.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Requiring the Drive Train</h4>

  <p>After you have a command created and named, you must indicate
  which subsystem it requires.</p>

  <p class="lead">To require a subsystem:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on the "Tank Drive".

      <p>It's properties will appear on the right.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click the cell to the right of requires, that contains
    "None".</li>

    <li>Select "Drive Train".</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Creating the Slow Tank Drive Command</h4>

  <p>Follow the steps above to create a command named "Slow Tank
  Drive"</p>

  <h4>Setting the Default Command for Drive Train</h4>

  <p>Subsystems can have default commands that run when no other
  command is running that performs the default behaviour.</p>

  <p class="lead">To set the default command:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on the "Drive Train".

      <p>It's properties will appear on the right.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click the cell to the right of default command, that
    contains "None".</li>

    <li>Select "Tank Drive".</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Operator Interface</h3>

  <p>The operator interface is the glue that connects the buttons
  on the operator interface to the commands that make the robot act
  in interesting ways. For more, see: <a href="OI.html">Operator
  Interface</a></p>

  <h4>Adding Joysticks to the Operator Interface</h4>

  <p>The operator interface needs some joysticks to control driving
  and other commands.</p>

  <p class="lead">To add joysticks to the operator interface:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Joystick" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over "Operator Interface" in the robot tree and
    release.</li>

    <li>Rename it to "Left Joystick".</li>

    <li>Check that it is Number 0.</li>

    <li>Click on "Joystick" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over "Operator Interface" in the robot tree and
    release.</li>

    <li>Rename it to "Right Joystick".</li>

    <li>Check that it is Number 1.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Adding a Joystick Button to the Operator Interface</h4>

  <p>Joystick buttons allow you to bind actions to buttons on a
  joystick.</p>

  <p class="lead">To add a joystick button to the operator
  interface:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Joystick Button" in the palette on the left.</li>

    <li>Drag it over "Operator Interface" in the robot tree and
    release.</li>

    <li>Rename it to "Slow Tank Drive Button".</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Configuring the Joystick Button</h4>

  <p>For the joystick button to do anything interesting, you have
  to configure it to run a command.</p>

  <p class="lead">To configure a joystick button:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Slow Tank Drive Button" in the robot tree.

      <p>It's properties will appear on the right.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click the cell to the right of joystick, that contains
    "None".</li>

    <li>Select "Left Joystick".</li>

    <li>Click the cell to the right of button.</li>

    <li>Select "1".</li>

    <li>Click the cell to the right of Command, that contains
    "None".</li>

    <li>Select "Slow Tank Drive".</li>

    <li>Click the cell to the right of when to run.</li>

    <li>Select "whileHeld".</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Generating Code</h3>
