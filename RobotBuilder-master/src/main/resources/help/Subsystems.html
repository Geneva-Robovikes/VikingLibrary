  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>A subsystem on a robot is a distinct part of the robot that
  performs a certain function. Within the command based robot
  framework, subsystems are encapsulated (represented) by
  classes.</p>

  <p class="lead">Subsystems can contain the following
  attributes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Sensors: Things that sense including buttons,
    potentiometers, encoders and more.</li>

    <li>Actuators: Things that move or act in the physical world,
    usually motors or pneumatics.</li>

    <li>State: The current status of the subsystem. This can
    include data recorded from sensors such as the position of an
    arm, the number of balls stored in a collector, information on
    progress towards a goal, a desired PID setpoint, and much
    more.</li>

    <li>Capabilities: Higher level actions that the subsystem can
    be told to perform by various commands. These are usually
    implemented by functions that update the subsystems state in
    some way.

      <p><b>Note:</b> Simple subsystems may be missing one or more
      of these attributes.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What is a default command?</h3>

  <p>Default commands are commands that run on a subsystem when no
  other command is running that requires the subsystem. They are
  the default behavior for the subsystem. This is often as simple
  as a do nothing command so that when a command driving the robot
  stops, the drive train of the robot stops as opposed to
  continuing the last motion it was given. It's
  also possible to have more complicated default commands such as a
  turret that continuously tracks a target when not doing anything
  else.</p>

  <p>Default commands are created just like any other command. The
  only minor difference when creating default commands is that you
  should generally have the isFinished() method return false so
  that the command is running continuously as opposed to stopping
  and restarting continuously when no other command is running.</p>
