  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>A command group is a group of other commands set to run in
  series and/or parallel with each other. Command groups are a good
  way to build up more complicated commands by using already tested
  components.</p>

  <h2>How are commands organized in a command group?</h2>

  <p>Commands can be dragged and dropped from the command palette
  and connected in order to form a command group. Commands in a
  command group can be either sequential or parallel commands. A
  sequential command will run in sequential order (one after
  another) while parallel commands will run concurrently (at the
  same time).</p>

  <h2>Are there any restrictions to how commands can be arranged in
  a command group?</h2>

  <p>Only one sequential command can be connected and run at one
  time, however, multiple sequential commands can be connected in
  series to run in order. Additionally, any number of parallel
  commands can be connected to run simultaneously. Sequential
  commands cannot be connected from parallel commands.</p>
